Wrapper for ido-compleating-read to use it in buffer

This is not tested. so at best good for snippets

* requirements
  this requires ido. But ido comes with the standard emacs build

* extra helpers
  added helper functions to generate standard compleation candidate lists

** icrib-search-all-buffers
   sertch all buffers in curren session for compleation candidates
   this takes all words that contains the search string so if you use ido fuzzy match
   you will match all that contains the string
*** inputs
    str: the string to compleate
    optional mmod: list of major mode buffers to sertch all others are ignored
    optional ignore: list of buffer names to ignore

    you need to ignore the *message* buffer if you print to it during execution

** icrib-buffer-and-tag-compleation
   run the compleation for candidates in all the buffers and in the tags table
   TODO: currently you need the tagstable to be loaded to use this.

*** inputs
    str: the string to compleate
    optional mmod: list of major mode buffers to sertch all others are ignored
    optional ignore: list of buffer names to ignore
    optional comp-list: extra list of compleation candidates
